# TðŸ‘€L - Truly Open Online Learning resources
The [TðŸ‘€L environment](https://openimitation.org) is a loosely organized set of resources to encourage the creation and sharing of online learning skills and solutions.

## Context and history
I've been having some interesting back-and-forth discussions with [Ivan Pepelnjak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanpepelnjak/), networking expert and author of [IPSpace.net](https://blog.ipspace.net/). To summarize, Ivan teaches networking and ended up [creating a lab scenario on Katacoda](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/04/katacoda-netsim-containerlab-frr.html)

[Katacoda.com](https://katacoda.com/ipspace/scenarios/netsim-containerlab-101) is created by O'Reilly, and offers free tier access to GitHub-based learning scenarios of all shapes and sizes. In a familiar, easy-to-use web browser environment students get to practice configuration exercises in the cloud. So that's wonderful, kudos to them for providing this learning-as-a-service platform. However, there are some limitations:
* The platform requires (free) registration, which represents a blocking issue for several people I spoke with
* The platform provides limited central resources, commodity cloud servers that are easy to get in general, but hard to customize in the Katacoda environment
* For students, the lab exercises are read-only - there is no built-in feedback mechanism

As Ivan pointed out, the key issue here isn't the tooling - tools are easily found, and instructions only a Google search away. The problem is getting **quality, updated and well maintained relevant content**.

## High quality maintained content at scale
