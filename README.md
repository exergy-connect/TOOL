# TðŸ‘€L - Truly Open Online Learning resources
The [TðŸ‘€L environment](https://openimitation.org) is a loosely organized set of resources to encourage the creation and sharing of online learning skills and solutions.

## Context and history
I've been having some interesting back-and-forth discussions with [Ivan Pepelnjak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanpepelnjak/), networking expert and author of [IPSpace.net](https://blog.ipspace.net/). To summarize a long story, Ivan teaches networking and ended up [creating a lab scenario on Katacoda](https://blog.ipspace.net/2021/04/katacoda-netsim-containerlab-frr.html)

[Katacoda.com](https://katacoda.com/ipspace/scenarios/netsim-containerlab-101) is created by O'Reilly, and offers free tier access to GitHub-based learning scenarios of all shapes and sizes. In a familiar, easy-to-use web browser environment students get to practice configuration exercises in the cloud.
